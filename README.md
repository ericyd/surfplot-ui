# surfplotjs
Surface plotting for visualizing mathematical surfaces

This app is under development.  The end goal is to basically create a modern, javascript-based 
version of [Calc Plot 3D](http://web.monroecc.edu/manila/webfiles/pseeburger/CalcPlot3D/).

We'll see how successful I am...

## Scripts
